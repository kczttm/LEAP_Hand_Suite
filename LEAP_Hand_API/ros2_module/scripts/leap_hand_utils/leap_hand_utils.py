'''
Some utilities for LEAP Hand that help with converting joint angles between each convention.

from re import L
import numpy as np

Embodiments:

LEAPhand: Real LEAP hand (180 for the motor is actual zero)
LEAPsim:  Leap hand in sim (has allegro-like zero positions)
one_range: [-1, 1] for all joints to facilitate RL
allegro:  Allegro hand in real or sim

#Safety clips all joints so nothing unsafe can happen. Highly recommend using this before commanding
def angle_safety_clip(joints):
    sim_min, sim_max = LEAPsim_limits()

###Sometimes it's useful to constrain the thumb more heavily(you have to implement here), but regular usually works good.

    return sim_min, sim_max

#this goes from [-1, 1] to [lower, upper]
