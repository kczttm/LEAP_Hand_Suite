## Welcome to the LEAP Hand SDK
- Please visit [our website](http://leaphand.com/) for more information about LEAP hand.
#### Software Setup
- Please see the [Python API](https://github.com/leap-hand/LEAP_Hand_API/tree/main/python), [ROS API](https://github.com/leap-hand/LEAP_Hand_API/tree/main/ros_module), [ROS2 API](https://github.com/leap-hand/LEAP_Hand_API/tree/main/ros2_module), [Useful Tools](https://github.com/leap-hand/LEAP_Hand_API/tree/main/useful_tools) folders for software specific details.

#### Hardware Setup
- Connect 5v power to the hand (the dynamixels should light up during boot up.)
- Connect the Micro USB cable to the hand (Do not use too many USB extensions)
- Open [Dynamixel Wizard](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/rplus1/dynamixel_wizard/) and find the correct port using the options button and put that in main.py or ros_example.py.  Note, you cannot have Dynamixel wizard open while using the hand's API, the port will be "busy" with the other process.
- On Ubuntu you can find the hand by ID using `/dev/serial/by-id` The ID will stay persistent on reboots.
- We offically support Python and ROS, but other languages are supported by [Dynamixel SDK](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/overview/).

#### Functionality
- Leap Node allows you to command joint angles in different scalings.
- You can read position, velocity and current from the hand.  
- Do not query reads too often, going past 90hz for one set of angles or 30hz for all three will slow down the USB communication.
- The default controller follows the PID control, up to the current limit cap. 
- Other controllers including velocity control or current control are supported as per the [motor manual](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xc330-m288/)
- For Lite, keep the current limit around 300ma.
- For Full, you can raise the current limit up to 550ma.
- If facing a jittery hand, adjust the PID values down.
- If the hand is too weak, adjust the PID values up.

#### Troubleshooting
- If your motor is 90/180/270 Degrees off, the horn is mounted incorrectly on the motor.  Remount it.
- If no motors show up, check that your serial port permissions are correct.
- If some motors are missing, make sure they are IDed corrrectly and are connected to the U2D2.
- If you get "overload error" and the motors are flashing red, then they have overloaded (self-collision etc). It should clear on a power cycle.  If it happens often, lower the current limits in the control code so that it does not happen as often.
- If you get "jittery" motors, try lowering the P and D values, either in the roslaunch file or the python file.
- If you feel the motors are too inaccurate, you can also try raising the P and D values.
- To improve latency on Ubuntu try these tips.   Configure [USB Latency Settings in Ubuntu](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/) and the [Dynamixel Python SDK](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK/issues/288)

#### Useful Tools:
- MANO to LEAP joint angle mapping.
- If you have useful tools you feel the community can benefit from, please make a pull request.
- Please see the code from [Bimanual Dexterity for Complex Tasks](https://bidex-teleop.github.io/) to use Manus gloves with LEAP Hand.
- I can also add tools to this upon request.  :)
